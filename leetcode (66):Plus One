题目：Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.

You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

def plusOne(digits):
    flag,res=1,[]
    for i in digits[::-1]:
        t=i+flag
        i,flag=(0,1) if t==10 else (t,0)
        res.insert(0,i)
    if flag:
        res.insert(0,1)
    return res


if __name__=="__main__":
    print(plusOne([9,9,9,9]))
    print(plusOne([1,9,9,9,9]))
    print(plusOne([1,9,9,9,8]))
    print(plusOne([1]))
    print(plusOne([1,9,9,2,9]))
输出：
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 9, 9, 9, 9]
[2]
[1, 9, 9, 3, 0]

class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        """
        :type digits: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        num = 0
        for i in range(len(digits)):
            num += digits[i] * pow(10, (len(digits)-1-i))
        return [int(i) for i in str(num+1)]
        
explanation：We're given a list of digits, and the idea here is to convert that list to an integer, num. 
    So each digit is multiplied by the proper place value and added to num. For example, if digits = [3, 8, 2, 5] 
    then on the first iteration 3 is multiplied by 10 to the power of 4-1-0 = 3, so this results in 3000, which is added to num.
    Then 8 is multiplied by 10^2 and added to num, and so on.
    The last step is to add 1 to num, convert it to a list and return that list.
